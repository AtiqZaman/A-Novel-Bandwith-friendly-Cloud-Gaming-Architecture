# A-Novel-Bandwith-friendly-Cloud-Gaming-Architecture
Cloud Gaming has the potential to make virtually any video game to be played on almost any client but high latency, low bandwidth and architectural constraints are major hurdles to attain the best Gaming Experience. To solve these problems, we propose a new modified cloud gaming architecture based on Edge Computing. Proposed architecture is based on client, server and super nodes. Implementation makes use of GamingAnyWhere which is an open source cloud gaming engine. Super Node enables the cloud to be only responsible for the sending its information to client, which significantly reduce the traffic hence the latency and bandwidth consumption.
